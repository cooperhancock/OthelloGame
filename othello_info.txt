Welcome to the Othello README

Running:

Run othello_driver.py

The program can be run with the following command line args:

debug
    activates debug mode, providing debugging readouts for game methods
log
    provides a turn by turn log file with basic debugging information
expert
    starts program directly into game, without running how-to sequence
basic-render
    disables clear() function, which may not work on Unix machines
    default run configuration will try clear() and notify the user if the function will not work on their machine

Program Structure:

Utilities
    contains global variables for modes controlled by command line args
    processes command line args

Othello Class
    init 
        initializes instance of Othello with starting player and board with starting configuration
    str 
        defines toString for object
        * has kind of weird spacing to allow for 2 digit valid move numbers
    move
        accepts a list of valid moves, a list of flip lists, and a move index
        places new tile according to valid move list at move index
        iterates through flip lists to find lists that correspond to the chosen move 
            flips tile at each coordinate in each needed flip list
    valid_moves
        iterates through each space on the board
        for each tile of the current player, 'looks' in each direction to see if there is a valid move in that direction
            if it 'finds' a valid move, it records it and the tiles it traversed to get to the valid move
        returns valid moves (list of coordinates), and a corresponding flip list (list of lists of coordinates to flip)
        each valid move will have a list of coordinates to flip in the flip list at the same index
    computer_chooser
        finds move closest to a corner
    render
        momentarily edits the board to display valid moves to the player
    
Non-Class Functions
    clear
        clears the terminal
        also has the ability to clear single lines in the terminal
    how_to
        runs through an introduction to the game so the player knows how to play

Debug
    contains a function for running various debugging features

Main 
    contains the main user interface for playing the game
